# Contracts Modifications

The requirements was to modify the given contract the less possible, only adding meaningful changes.

I added a DOS protection when submitting proposals

```solidity
require(proposalsArray.length <= 1000, 'Too many proposals');
```

And tested it was still possible to tally with this amount of proposals:

```console
    Testing DOS adding proposals
      âœ“ tally if 1000 proposals (POV voter1) (11404ms, 61335302 gas)
```

I added the voting question on chain, also.

```solidity
string public question;

constructor(string memory _question) Ownable() {
  question = _question;
}
```
